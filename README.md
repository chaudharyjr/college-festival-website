# college-festival-website
I designed and developed the front end of the techno-cultural festival Excelsior's website. Technologies used for the development are HTML, CSS, Bootstrap framework, jQuery. The festival was organized by the students of U.I.E.T KUK and I was part of the developers team of the festival.
